# Mathematical operations in WOQL

WOQL has a number of mathematical operations that can be
performed. These include, `plus`, `minus`, `divide`, `times`, `div`
(for integer division), `exp` and `floor`.

To use these operations you need to `evaluate` an arithmetic
expression, and then you will be able to bind the result to a
variable.

For instance:

```javascript
let v = Vars("result");
evaluate(times(2,3), v.result)
```

This will store the value of 2 times 3 in the variable `result`.  The
bindings which result from this query are:

```json
[ {"result": {"@type":"xsd:decimal", "@value":6}} ]
```

You can also chain these together, to build up more complicated
computations, or use the results obtained by queries to derive new
values.


```javascript
let v = Vars("result1", "result2");
and(evaluate(times(2,3), v.result1),
    evaluate(times(v.result1,3), v.result2))
```

Which results in:

```json
[ {"result1": {"@type":"xsd:decimal", "@value":6},
   "result2": {"@type":"xsd:decimal", "@value":18}} ]
```
