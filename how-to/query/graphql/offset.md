Once you have cloned the database, go to the GraphQL icon (triangle in
hexagon) on the left hand side and select the filing cabinet icon.

There are two panels, one on the left for query, and one
on the right for results.

## Adding an offset

The `offset` keyword is most often used with the [limit](./limit.md)
keyword which when used together enable paging of results.

For instance, we can get exactly 5 people from the star-wars universe
by specifying the query here:

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 5){
      label
   }
}
```

This will result in

```json
{
  "data": {
    "People": [
      {
        "label": "Luke Skywalker"
      },
      {
        "label": "Obi-Wan Kenobi"
      },
      {
        "label": "Anakin Skywalker"
      },
      {
        "label": "Wilhuff Tarkin"
      },
      {
        "label": "Chewbacca"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If we then want to get the *next* page of data we can write:

```graphql
query{
   People(limit: 5, offset: 5){
      label
   }
}
```

This will result in:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "People": [
      {
        "label": "Han Solo"
      },
      {
        "label": "Greedo"
      },
      {
        "label": "Jabba Desilijic Tiure"
      },
      {
        "label": "Wedge Antilles"
      },
      {
        "label": "Jek Tono Porkins"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
